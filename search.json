    "text": "I’ve had a complex relationship with blogging. I’ve always wanted to blog but found it too much of a hassle.\nThen I stumbled upon this post and decided to start my own blog documenting my journey as a Machine Learning enthusiast.\nThis blog will principally be a way for me to digest what I’ve learned (the best way of learning is teaching), share my thoughts and the projects I do.\nI had two main choices for blogging, the first is Medium and the second is through Github Pages.\nFor no explainable reason I never liked Medium maybe because of the annoying reading limit it has when it asks you to connect (I hold grudges easily). As for Github Pages, I found Jekyll too much of a pain to deal with, too lazy to learn its intricacies.\nFortunately this year I decided to start the famous fast.ai course and Jeremy kept talking about Quarto and how it generates blog posts from Jupyter Notebooks. I also stumbled upon this blog of a fellow fast.ai student and used his posts to create my own blog.\nSo let me share with you How I did it:"
